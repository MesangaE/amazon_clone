Today we will deploy the Amazon app in AWS ec2 using Terraform as an infrastructure-building tool. Then we automate the whole process using Jenkins which allows us continuous integration and continuous deployment (ci-cd) and then we set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. To start this project, I decided to first clone the repo into my local and do modifications on the Terraform files (region, ami, I created a new keypair as well so I added that resource to the resource block)

=======
Deployment of Amazon clone app using Terraform and Jenkins ci-cd

Pre-requisite
AWS account
basics of terraform and Jenkins

Let's do it
before doing anything →
open your terminal and make a separate folder for Amazon →mkdir amazon
cd amazon
clone the GitHub repo
git clone https://github.com/Aakibgithuber/Amazon-app-Deployment-using-terraform-and-jenkins.git

<h3>STEPS</h3>
<h3>Step 1: Setup Terraform and configure aws on your local machine</h3>
  sudo su
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  sudo apt install wget -y
  wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee 
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
  which terraform (/usr/bin/terraform)

  <h2>create an IAM user</h2>
  
  go to IAM on the console and click users
  Give your user a name, check the Provide user access to the management console, and then click on I want an IAM user option.

  choose a password for your user →click next
  Attach the policies directly to your IAM user → click next
  click on Create user

  download your password file if it is autogenerated otherwise it is your choice

  Click on your newly created  IAM user →security credentials

  scroll down to access keys and create an access keys


  ![clone user 6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6094bbc-3ac4-40e0-b4ec-2f3d2ca21f29)

  

  choose aws cli from the options listed



  ![cloneuser7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7705aa3-b164-4155-95dc-f90a64f0fb34)
  

  click next and download your CSV file for username and password

  <br>
  go to your terminal and configure AWS with these user credentials

  ---bash
      sudo apt install awscli 
      aws configure
  ---


  ![configureaws](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b8efb5a-400e-4f62-b5ea-de84457c6e2f)


  note →I will provide the administrator access for now but we are careful while attaching the policies on your workspace

<h3>Step 2: Building a simple Infrastructure from code using Terraform</h3>

 cd JENKINS-TF
there are three files, main.tf, install_jenkins.sh, provider.tf
modify the Main.tf file with ami ID and key name.PersonallyI cloned the repo into my local and did the modifications before I pushed it to my repo then I downloaded my modified repo
 
Step 3 → Setup Sonarqube and Jenkins
Step 4 → ci-cd pipeline
Step5 → Monitering via Prmotheus and grafana
Step 6 → Terraform Destroy

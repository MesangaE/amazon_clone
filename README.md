Today we will deploy the Amazon app in AWS ec2 using Terraform as an infrastructure-building tool. Then we automate the whole process using Jenkins which allows us continuous integration and continuous deployment (ci-cd) and then we set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring. To start this project, I decided to first clone the repo into my local and do modifications on the Terraform files (region, ami, I created a new keypair as well so I added that resource to the resource block)

=======
Deployment of Amazon clone app using Terraform and Jenkins ci-cd

Pre-requisite
AWS account
basics of terraform and Jenkins

Let's do it
before doing anything →
open your terminal and make a separate folder for Amazon →mkdir amazon
cd amazon
clone the GitHub repo
git clone https://github.com/Aakibgithuber/Amazon-app-Deployment-using-terraform-and-jenkins.git

<h3>STEPS</h3>
<h3>Step 1</h3>.→ Setup Terraform and configure aws on your local machine
  sudo su
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  sudo apt install wget -y
  wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
  echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee 
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
  which terraform (/usr/bin/terraform)

  <h2>create an IAM user</h2>
  go to IAM on the console and click users.
  Give a name to your user and tick on Provide user access to the management console and then click on I want an IAM user option.
  choose a password for your user →click next
  Attach the policies directly to your IAM user → click next
  click on Create user
  download your password file if it is autogenerated otherwise it is your choice
  Now click on your IAM user →security credentials
  scroll down to access keys and create an access keys
  choose aws cli from the options listed
  click next and download your CSV file for username and password
  go to your terminal and configure AWS with these user credentials

  note →I will provide the administrator access for now but we are careful while attaching the policies on your workspace
  
<h3>Step 2</h3>  Building a simple Infrastructure from code using Terraform
 cd JENKINS-TF
there are three files, main.tf, install_jenkins.sh, provider.tf
modify the Main.tf file with ami ID and key name.PersonallyI cloned the repo into my local and did the modifications before I pushed it to my repo then I downloaded my modified repo
 
Step 3 → Setup Sonarqube and Jenkins
Step 4 → ci-cd pipeline
Step5 → Monitering via Prmotheus and grafana
Step 6 → Terraform Destroy
